Jessica is an engineer at GitHub with a passion for clean code and the Kansas City Royals. She once ran 70 miles through the Santa Monica Mountains "just for fun". When she's not writing code, she can be found running aimlessly through city streets training for her next ultra or creating code-related videos on YouTube for CompChomp. She is an avid squirrel photographer and loves the color green.
