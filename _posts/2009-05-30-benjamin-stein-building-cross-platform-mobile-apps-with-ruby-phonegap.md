Surging popularity for rich mobile applications has left many once
cutting edge Ruby developers feeling left behind. Developing for
Android, the iPhone, and Blackberry requires completely different
skill sets (Objective-C, Java, and new APIs).  And just serving up a
lite version of your customer's web site is only a half-baked
solution.

Consider this alternative technology stack for mobile devices:

* The WebKit rendering engine on phones lets you build applications
with standard HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Web content can live locally,
remotely, or both.
* The HTML 5 specification gives you local persistent storage via a
Javascript interface to SQLite.
* The PhoneGap project (http://phonegap.com) exposes all the new
exciting mobile features (GPS, accelerometer, phone, vibration, sound)
through a common Javascript API.

Now Rubyists can create "native" mobile applications for all 3
platforms simultaneously using their favorite web development tools.
And all the business logic can be served directly from their RESTful
Rails application!
