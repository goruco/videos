<p>
  In the early days of a project, Rails absolutely dazzles.
</p>
<p>Tragically, the very same forces that make it so easy to add new features to a brand new Rails application are the ones that start to hold you back as the number of features grows.</p>
<p>Your test suite gets slower and slower, and refactoring becomes more and more of a chore. Everything seems coupled together, and it's hard to see much of a structure other than the MVC triad.</p>
<p>In this talk, Matt explains why this happens, and shows you a way out, using a ports-and-adapters or hexagonal architecture to introduce a separation between your application's domain logic, and the Rails framework.</p>
<p><strong>With practical examples, you'll learn how to apply techniques like:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>tell-don't-ask</li>
  <li>domain services</li>
  <li>value objects</li>
  <li>view models</li>
  <li>presenters</li>
</ul>
<p>This talk is suitable for advanced Rubyists who want to enjoy the benefits of Ruby's great Object-Oriented and functional programming features in their Rails applications.</p>
