Back in September 2013 I taught a class of 12 middle-school aged girls to write code in Scratch on the Raspberry Pi and program simple electronic circuits. This was a workshop for  the Philadelphia non-profit TechGirlz.

I created 5 structured activities using Scratch and simple electronics that covered both good programming principles and the basics of electronic circuits. https://github.com/atroutt/scratch-pi

I will be sharing these structured projects as a template for other beginner workshops, and talk about what I learned by building and teaching this workshop.

####I'll cover

* What can be effectively covered in a day?
* How can you setup a workshop up to maximize fun and learning on the day
* Demos of some of the best projects!
