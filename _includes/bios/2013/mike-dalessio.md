Mike Dalessio has a serious job as Director of [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com) NYC, where he hardly ever gets to write software anymore. But that doesn't mean he's all business -- he's been having super happy fun times coding for over 20 years.

Co-author of Nokogiri, Enterprisey Doer of Good Deeds and veteran of startup failure and success, this Rubyist believes Elvis is still alive and considers 72 columns the canonical code width (because, FORTRAN, that's why).
