<p>Memory usage can be difficult to analyze.  In this presentation we will cover different techniques for analyzing memory usage of a Ruby process including in-process analysis tools as well as system level tools.  After doing memory analysis, we&#39;ll look at some ways to reduce overall memory used by the system.  Attendees will leave with practical tips and tricks for memory analysis in their Ruby systems, as well as a better understanding of Ruby internals.</p>
