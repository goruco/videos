GraphQL is an exciting new query language that's transforming the way we think about APIs. Used in production by Facebook, GitHub, and Shopify, it challenges RESTful API design by empowering consumers to query for exactly the information they need. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the query language, how GitHub uses it internally with Ruby and Rails, and the lessons they learned launching their GraphQL API externally.
