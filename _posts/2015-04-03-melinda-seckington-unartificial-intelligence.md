HAL, Skynet, KITTâ€¦ we've always been intrigued by artificial intelligence, but have you ever stopped to considered the un-artificial?

Most developers are familiar with the basics of AI: how do you make a computer, an algorithm, a system learn something? How do you model real world problems in such a way that an artificial mind can process them? What most don't realize though is that the same principles can be applied to people.

This talk looks at some of the theories behind how machines learn versus how people learn, and maps it to real life examples of how specifically our users learn their way around interfaces and how designers and developers apply learning methodologies in their day-to-day actions.
