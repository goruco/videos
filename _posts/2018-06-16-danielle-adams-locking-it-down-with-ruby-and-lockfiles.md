<p>Anyone that&#39;s developed with open source has probably been burned by a dependency issue of some sort. The time spent (minutes? hours? years?) debugging dependency-related code adds up- but lockfiles drastically reduce the headache! I&#39;d like to discuss the ins and outs of dependency management in Ruby, a little history, and how lockfiles give us our valuable development time back.</p>
