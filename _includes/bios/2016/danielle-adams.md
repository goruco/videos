Danielle is a full-stack software engineer working at Blue Apron on their Warehouse Management System software. She mostly works with Ember.js, but she is always happy when she's able to jump into the back-end and work on the API, built with Ruby on Rails. Having been a professional developer for just under 2 years, she has been coding since age 12. In her free time, she enjoys live music, food, and playing with puppies.
