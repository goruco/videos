Archaeopteryx generates MIDI bytecodes which produce music via
prosumer applications such as Propellerhead Reason. If you&#8217;ve ever
wondered whether or not use cases really exist for Ruby features like
lambda, eval, continuations, and higher-order functions, Archaeopteryx
demonstrates not just the usefulness but the power and flexibility of
these techniques. Archaeopteryx also uses statistical AI methods -
specifically, probability matrices, similar to those used in naive
Bayesian classifiers &#8211; to define templates for possible grooves.


An experiment in progress, Archaeopteryx currently generates techno
drum rhythms and New-Agey ambient soundscapes with ease. Developing
additional features by the time of GoRuCo is very, very likely.
Following the pattern of all successful technology projects,
Archaeopteryx targets low-hanging fruit with superior technology, and
scales up from there. This presentation will feature no slides at all,
and focus instead on demonstrations, explaining existing code, and
writing new code live.
