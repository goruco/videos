<p>Whether you call it microservices or SOA, service autonomy is the quality of the architecture that dictates whether you end up with the services implementation of your dreams, or a tangled mess. Event Sourcing is the path of least resistance to service architecture, and the only way to realize the service autonomy that keeps your efforts from going off the rails. With examples of service components produced entirely in Ruby, this presentation describes the patterns and anti patterns of service architecture, and demonstrates the basics of message and event-oriented design, development, and testing.</p>
