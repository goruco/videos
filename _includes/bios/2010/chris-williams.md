Chris Williams is the curator of JSConf, owner of Iterative Designs, and VP of OurParents. More commonly known, internetwise, by the handle of voodootikigod, he has been known from time to time to fancy a good beer. With a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, he has been a network security developer for the DOD, Security Engineer for TSA, and a parallel entrepreneur. In terms of Ruby, I have whole slew of Ruby/Sinatra/Rails/etc projects from a directory service, legal office groupware, automated patent aggregation and analysis tools, and a full stack call center system.
