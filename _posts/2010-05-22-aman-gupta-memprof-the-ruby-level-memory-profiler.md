Ever wondered why your ruby script uses so much RAM? Tired of having god restart your rails app every few hours?

This talk will introduce memprof, a ruby level memory profiler. We’ll demo memprof on a variety of real-world examples, including some popular open source projects, to find and fix memory leaks. Along the way, we’ll learn how the ruby VM manages memory, why garbage collection has such a large impact on ruby’s performance and some common ways to reduce the memory usage of your ruby applications.
