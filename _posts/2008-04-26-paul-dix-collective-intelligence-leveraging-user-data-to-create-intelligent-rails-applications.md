Take advantage of user data to create intelligent applications. This
talk will focus on data mining to create complex application behavior
and gain insight into the patterns and habits of your users. Examples
of these techniques can be seen with recommendation systems like those
created by Amazon, Netflix, last.fm, and others. Additional examples
include spam filtering systems for email or comment filtering provided
by Akismet.


We will focus on techniques for gathering data, specific gems and
plugins for performing various data mining and machine learning tasks,
and performance issues like how to distribute the work to separate
servers. Theory in this talk will be light and the specific algorithms
will only get a mention by name. We&#8217;ll be looking at real world Ruby
and Rails code examples for building recommendation, ranking, and
classification systems.
