Lauren has been doing web development for nearly a decade. Spending the first five years of her time in front-end development, she has since started diving deeper into the stack. She is currently burning her spare time by working on a project aiming to make organizing events or hangouts less of a pain. When she isn't programming, she can be found teaching courses or TAing with [Girl Develop It! Pittsburgh](http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/pittsburgh), discussing queer and gender theory, encouraging tech diversity in whatever way she can, doing trick shots with a whip, or fire spinning.
