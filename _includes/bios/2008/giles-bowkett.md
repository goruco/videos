<a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles Bowkett's</a> programming blog is well-read in the Ruby community
and occasionally gets 10,000-visit days. He has worked with Perl, <span class="caps">PHP</span>,
Python, Java, JavaScript, ActionScript &#8211; all the usual suspects &#8211; and
now spends nearly all his time coding Ruby. He&#8217;s worked on the
streaming video site Hulu and contributed a patch to Rubinius, he has
a recipe in the upcoming &#8220;Advanced Rails Recipes&#8221; book, he&#8217;s speaking
at five conferences in three countries in 2008, he regularly checks in
code before 8am on Saturdays, he kind of needs to get a life, and
between December and February 2007-2008 he released 9 open source
projects (with more coming). Giles studies acting with the same
feverish intensity he applies to programming. He also practices
meditation, which, when you consider everything else, is probably a
good idea.
