<p>As engineers we place a lot of emphasis in the things that we build. However lots of the software we write is destined for deletion. What does this do to our definition of &#39;doing great work&#39;?</p> <p>Is &quot;great work&quot; inherent to the code you write? Is it your customer&#39;s results? Is it anything to do with the output in the first place?</p> <p>Come and examine the role of teams, personal relationships and your own attitude in your day to day work, as well as in the broader cycle of a whole career and our industry.</p>
