<p>These days new Ruby releases are regarded with less and less fanfare. We rejoiced at all the new features and support of Ruby 1.9 and 2.0! Since then, we've become a bit jaded: <em>&quot;Refinements? Yeah, they&#39;re OK.&quot; &quot;Immutable String pragma? Yawn!&quot; &quot;<code>yield_self</code>? Don't we already have <code>tap</code>?</em></p> <p>In fact, Ruby has delivered in myriad ways over the last several releases. From more support for functional-style programming to vast speed improvements, the Ruby core team is firing on all cylinders. Let's talk about what&#39;s been done, what&#39;s on the horizon, and get excited about programming Ruby again!</p>
