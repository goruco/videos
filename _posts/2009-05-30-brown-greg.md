For those who want to run a standard Ruby build, we've got Ruby 1.8.6,
Ruby 1.8.7, and Ruby 1.9.1 to choose from.  This alone can create
confusion for the uninitiated as well as complications for the
seasoned Ruby veteran.   But our choices are actually far more diverse
than that.   While alternative implementations may have previously
been a concern only for language design geeks, the chances that you'll
encounter JRuby, MacRuby, and even Rubinius in the wild become greater
each day.  Throw things like Sapphire and "Ruby Enterprise Edition"
into the mix and you end up with a perfect storm of WTF on your hands
with a side order of FUD.

If we try to answer the question "Which Ruby Should I Use?", the
answer is invariably "It Depends".  This talk will give the audience a
chance to see what the variables are and help them reach the sweet
spot based on several common needs.  It will also hint at the
challenges involved in writing implementation agnostic Ruby code, to
give those who can't make up their minds something to chew on as well.
