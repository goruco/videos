Michael Bernstein is obsessed. Not with anything in particular, just in general. He’s a Brooklyn, NYC based software developer and amateur Computer Scientist who writes at [michaelrbernste.in](http://michaelrbernste.in/) and tweets (too much) at mrb_bk. He works at Code Climate, and he’s given talks on Garbage Collection and Distributed Systems in the past. He is very excited to hang and chat with fellow NYC obsessives.
