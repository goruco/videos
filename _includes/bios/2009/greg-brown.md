<a href="http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/">Gregory Brown</a> is the author of "Ruby Best Practices" and an
all-around crunchy person.  He took off half a year in 2008 to work on
the PDF generation library Prawn, supported by the kindness of the
Ruby community.  Gregory lives in New Haven, CT with his girlfriend,
some small animals, and a bamboo plant that seems to live without
water.
