Aloha! Inspired by the Ruby on Rails Community, Justin began blogging on http://www.railsonmaui.com. A burning desire to bring happiness to Rails front-end development led to the open source project React on Rails. Besides open source, he’s the founder and CEO of http://www.shakacode.com and https://www.friendsandguests.com. Justin has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and an MBA from UC Berkeley. Free Time: Surfing and other sports in Hawaii!
