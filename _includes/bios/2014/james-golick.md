My name is James Golick. I write code, build companies, and talk for a living. I also like to snowboard, play golf, stand on my hands, and listen to music, but not professionally.

As far as software is concerned, I'm interested in well structured, highly modular code, and scalability / operations (in other words, what actually happens when you put code in to production).

I love to write and give talks on the misinformation floating around about building and operating applications at scale. I also release quite a bit of open source software.
