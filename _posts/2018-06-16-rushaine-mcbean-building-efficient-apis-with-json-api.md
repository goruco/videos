<p>Most web applications have RESTful APIs for either internal or external use or mobile apps and that comes with many approaches to design and standardize for a team. If you’re already using JSON responses, following the JSON API spec is a natural progression to provide consistent responses. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the spec,  it’s main feature benefits, how it can be implemented in a Rails app and the lessons learned. </p>
