<p>We all operate software, and we all know that it can fail. There&#39;s nothing quite like that adrenaline inducing, heart rate raising, spine tingling moment when you know something is broken, and you are the one to fix it. But the question is, once you&#39;ve fixed it, what happens afterwards? How do you make this never happen again?</p> <p>In this talk, you&#39;ll learn about postmortem analysis. A tool you can apply to make your production software more resilient to failure. You&#39;ll learn how to understand human vs machine cause, and how to operate your software a little better. This talk is technical, but should be accessible to Ruby developers of all skill level.</p>
