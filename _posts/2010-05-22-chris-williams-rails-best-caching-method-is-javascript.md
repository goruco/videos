One of the most critical and often overlooked (and abused) elements of any web application is the JavaScript component. In the Rails world, there is a constant and expensive circle of instrumenting, optimizing, and scaling, which can quickly wear down a team and seed funding. This talk dives deep into super JavaScript nerdery to massively “rethink” the way a Rails application is designed and put into production. I have implemented and deployed this for a variety of sites when Rails performance and scaling became overly complex and expensive. With just a (beautiful) few lines of JavaScript, scale and performance became a non-issue. Furthermore this technique also facilitates moving “high traffic” components into better and faster implements with limited effort.
