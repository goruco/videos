It’s never easy to have a tough conversations, and they never go away. Therefore, I see a better way to live with them, and I want everyone to hear it: empower yourself to understand why we do what we do so you can effect change. Understanding creates empathy. Empathy reduces (not eliminates) conflict. This talk is a practical course on the triad of human psychology: language, physiology and focus. I’ll walk through simple strategies that lower stress, create empathy and manage emotions.
