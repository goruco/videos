The concrete principles of object-oriented design are useful but are built upon powerful concepts that the principles tend to obscure. When design principles become goals in and of themselves, object-oriented design gets a bad name and applications suffer.

This talk strips away the well-known design principles and exposes the hidden, underlying goals of design. It reveals programming techniques that allow you to write less code while creating beautiful, flexible applications. These techniques all involve less. Doing less, debugging less, testing less and knowing less, all in service of achieving more.
