[Jake Howerton](http://jake.howmeta.com/) is a developer from Brooklyn, NY. Jake has been a
(relatively) active member of #nycrb and been working professionally
with Ruby and Ruby on Rails projects since late 2005. Jake has served
as the Chief Technologist of startup space Sunshine Suites, and is
currently working to help scale infrastructure for TuneCore.com. Some
might say that Jake has an unhealthy obsession with entrepreneurial
pursuits, economic theory, and backpacks.
